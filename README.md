# MVC Tech Blog

## Objective

The objective of this project was to build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site. The application should allow users to publish blog posts and comment on others' blog posts. The application has a login/logout option, a signup option that saves user credentials, and the user is able to edit or delete any blog posts they have previously submitted. The application also has a timeout setting that logs the user out if they are idle for more than a set time, and prompts them to sign back in.
